# Basic Matrix Multiplication
As you may know, one of the fundamental algorithms covered in the "Design of Algorithms" course is matrix multiplication. I believe implementing this algorithm is a great starting point for practicing the concepts in this course.
The main part of this source code is based on three *for* loops, hence the time complexity of the program is **O(n<sup>3</sup>)**. It's worth mentioning that the number of additions is n<sup>3</sup>-n<sup>2</sup> due to inital 
multiplication on line *62*.
